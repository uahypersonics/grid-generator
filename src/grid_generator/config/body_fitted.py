"""Configuration contract for constant-height body-fitted 2D grids.

The [geometry] table is canonical-geometries' contract, without the keys that only
say how far the body extends: the grid's body ends at [domain] x_end. For plate,
wedge and cone the loader fills length in from x_end; for the tangent ogive (whose
length is a shape parameter) a cylinder carries the body on when x_end lies past the
base. The config is parsed and validated with pydantic; the generator works from the
validated object.

The [points] tables use the same distribution types and keys as the Cartesian axes,
without start and end: those come from the geometry and [domain]. The body starts at
the nose spacing, so the wall spacing is continuous across the junction.

An optional [span] table extrudes the 2D grid in z into a 3D grid (plate and wedge
only). It takes the same distribution types and keys as the Cartesian axes.
