"""Starter configurations written by `grid-generator <command> init`.

The templates are put together from TOML blocks: per geometry (description,
[geometry], [domain]), and shared blocks for the points, span, markers and output. The body
and wall-normal distributions each have a choice of block (init --body, --normal),
the span block is optional (init --span), and Cartesian grids pick their axes
(init --dims). 1D distributions take their example from the distribution reference
(init --type). Every combination is a complete, valid file.
